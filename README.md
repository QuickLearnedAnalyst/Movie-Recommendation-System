# Movie Recommendation System (2025)

This project is a content-based Movie Recommendation System developed using Python. It recommends similar movies based on user input by analyzing various content features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew. The project is designed to help users quickly find movies of their interest using real-world metadata from TMDb.

## Key Features

- Suggests movies similar to the user's favorite movie
- Uses cosine similarity to find the most relevant recommendations
- Cleans and combines metadata like genres, keywords, cast, and crew
- Includes real-world data processing and NLP-based text vectorization

## Real-World Relevance (2025 Focus)

- Designed to solve the common user problem of "What should I watch next?"
- Helps OTT platforms or content aggregators improve user experience
- Demonstrates the use of machine learning and vectorization techniques in recommendation engines

## Technologies Used

- Python (v3.11.7)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
- Jupyter Notebook
- TMDb API (for real metadata)

## About the Project

This is a self-initiated project created by *Abhijit Salistekar*, a Data Analyst aspirant, as part of portfolio development in 2025. The project was built to demonstrate end-to-end data handling, feature engineering, and recommendation logic using real-world movie data.
